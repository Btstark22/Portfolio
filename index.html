                I am a hardworking individual that genuinely enjoy's coding. I am easy going, out going, easy to work with, and good at working in a team and even prefer it. Although relatively new to coding, I've learned a lot throughout the course, but understand that there is still lots to learn. One thing the course has taught me is that there is always something to learn in the coding world.

            <p class="about-me-p">
                Like most coders I am also a nerd. I enjoy Playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends, lots of chess, and I'll play any new board game you put in front of me, although I prefer strategy games. I also enjoy playing any sport that involves a ball or a puck. I love Minnesota, where I come from, and my friends and family here, but I am willing to relocate if need be.
